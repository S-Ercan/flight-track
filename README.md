# flight-track
A Flask application for tracking flights close to a given location.
It uses data collected from [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/).

The initial page shows a list of all flights within a radius of about 15 kilometers from this location.
Clicking on a flight then redirects to a page with more details about the flight.
